rules = "Hello " + player_name + "! You have been given the mission of travelling to as many as heliports in Europe! You will be given a helicopter and a Co2 budget of 10.000 which you cannot exceed. For every 1000km you use 200 Co2.\n\
Your starting location will be random. From that point you can choose to fly to any country, however the heliport will be random. \nYou have 3 rounds/lives, you collect 100 points for each continent per round. \n\
Every time before you fly a dice of destiny will be rolled. The outcomes of the rolls are as follows:\n\
6. You get a full Co2 refund for that particular flight.\n\
5. You get a 50% Co2 refund for that particular flight.\n\
4. Your plane had to return to the previous heliport. Full amount of Co2 wasted for that trip.\n\
3. Your helicopter's GPS breaks and you end up at a random destination anywhere in the world.\n\
2. You had to take an unexpected detour. Double the amount of Co2 consumed.\n\
